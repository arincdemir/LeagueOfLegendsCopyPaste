# LeagueOfLegendsCopyPaste
Allows you to paste messages in league of legends in-game. 

You have to install python 3 and ```keyboard``` module to use it. 

To install keyboard module just open up cmd and type ```pip install keyboard``` 

The shortcut to write down the message is ```alt + shift + z``` right now, however you can change it easily by editing main.py, it's pretty intuitive.
